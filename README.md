# Library_Database_Management
This project involves the design and implementation of a Library Database Management System using SQL. The database is created by integrating data from multiple CSV files, organizing it into tables with appropriate data types, and establishing relationships between them using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Key functionalities include executing SQL queries to manage library operations, such as tracking book inventories, managing borrower information, and extracting insights from the database. The project demonstrates practical database management skills and the application of SQL for real-world problem-solving.
